Create an easy dashboard for your users with links deeper into the WordPress admin, all driven by JSON.

== Description ==
Zoneboard replaces the default WordPress dashboard (wait, you were reading WordPress news there?) with a grid of boxes that organize tasks for editors. The organization is up to you. Create a json file and organize as you'd like. You can even include font-awesome and dash-icons to enhance each box.
